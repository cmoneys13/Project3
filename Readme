## Introduction

This project uses Microsoft AirSim to simulate a swarm of drones that take off, form letters to spell "Would You Marry Me?", and then land. The script utilizes the AirSim Python API for drone control and the NumPy library for numerical operations.

## Features

- Connect to the AirSim simulator
- Control multiple drones simultaneously
- Form letters using predefined drone positions
- Implement basic swarm intelligence principles
- Sequentially display each letter in the message

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Microsoft AirSim
- Unreal Engine

### Libraries

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install airsim numpy DroneKit​ OpenCV​ Scikitlearn​ Tensorflow​

  Usage
Set up the simulation environment:

Download and install Unreal Engine from the Unreal Engine website.
Clone the AirSim repository and set it up:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim.git
cd AirSim
./setup.sh
./build.sh
Open an AirSim project (e.g., AirSim/Unreal/Environments/Blocks) in Unreal Engine and click Play to start the simulation.
Run the Python script: Project3
